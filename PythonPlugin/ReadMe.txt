    ISADORA PLUGIN : PythonPlugin Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created the PythonPlugin Isadora Plugin Project for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your PythonPlugin application.

PythonPlugin.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

PythonPlugin.cpp
    This is the main plugin source file.

	When created, the plugin DLL does not export any symbols. As a result, it
	will not produce a .lib file when it is built. If you wish this project
	to be a project dependency of some other project, you will either need to
	add code to export some symbols from the DLL so that an export library
	will be produced, or you can set the Ignore Input Library property to Yes
	on the General propert page of the Linker folder in the project's Property
	Pages dialog box.
